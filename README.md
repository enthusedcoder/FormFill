# FormFill
This is a form filler program that I wrote.  Rather than read the tags of HTML forms and inputing information that way, this form filler allows the user to select information that they have stored in the form filler and, when the user clicks in an input box and the mouse cursor is displaying as the "carret", will automatically write the information curretly selected in form filler, which allows it to work on any file, document, or form which you would need to fill.  The executable (passw.exe) contains a help file which can be accessed by pressing "F1" when the GUI appears and is the only file needed for the script to function.

NOTE: If you have difficulty viewing the content of the built in help file, please follow the tutorial [here for Windows 8 - 10](http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-unblock-files-downloaded-from-internet-in-windows-10/) or [here for windows 7](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/delay/p/unblockingdownloadedfile/).

## Prerequisite
NOTE: The application requires that Microsoft Office (specifically Word) be installed on your machine, as the application uses Word for its spell checking functionality.  But since just about everyone uses word, chances are you will be able to use it.
